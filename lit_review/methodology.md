# Common MCDA Methods

Commonly used MCDM methods include:
- Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Analytic Network Process (ANP)
- ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité (ELECTRE)
- Goal Programming (GP)
- Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) and Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT)
- The Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE)
- The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)
- Weighted Sum Model (WSM)

AHP, TOPSIS, and PROMETHEE methods wre the ones most frequently used among these mentioned above:

The AHP and ANP methods proposed by Saaty (1980) utilize pair-wise comparison metrics, which allow experts and decision-makers to compare two criteria at a time rather than comparing all of them at once (Zapolskytė, 2020).  The decision makers’ preferences are determined using a verbal scale and the preferential weights are obtained to establish a final ranking of alternatives (Diaz-Balteiro L, 2017).

TOPSIS approach selects an optimal combination of the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS) and the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS), considering trade-offs for each alternative in relation to the criteria (Savun-Hekimoğlu B, 2021). The advantages are that its logic is rational, the computational method is easy-to-understand, and the relevance weights have been included in a comparison process (Rubio-Aliaga, 2021).

PROMETHEE is another alternative outranking method that can be used when there are conflicting criteria and is often used for environmental problems like life cycle assessment (Savun-Hekimoğlu B, 2021).  

## Hybridization 

Some of the main challenges in MCDM are dealing with different kinds of information: quantitative and qualitative, information in different units, and dealing with fuzzy information, and different kinds of uncertainty (Ilangkumaran M, 2013).  As a result, in recent years, there has been an increasing trend in the development and use of novel hybrid methods, combining methods to draw on the strongest aspects of each technique (Bhole G P, 2018). In renewable energy studies, AHP has become popular due to its procedural simplicity, but outranking techniques like ELECTRE III and PROMETHE are also frequently used (Kumar A, 2017). 

## Criteria Selection

*We don't have to follow this, but would be a good resource to consult from*

As for criteria selection, a review of literature on water issues shows a trend of categorizing the criteria into three to four dimensions, including economic, environmental, social, and technical factors, while each of them often can be divided into two or more additional sub-criteria. Salamirad et al (2023) selected economic, environmental, and social factors, including 12 sub-criteria to select wastewater treatment technology for agricultural usages in Iran (Salamirad, 2023); Huang (2022) and Liu (2023) chose 8 criteria from 4 dimensions, including environmental, economic, social, and technological factors for selection of renewable desalination technology (Liu, 2023) , (Huang, 2022)

Another relevant parameter is the number of experts to be consulted for criteria selection and prioritization/assessment. Salamirad et al. (2023) conducted criteria screening with 22 wastewater treatment experts after selecting criteria from literature reviews, suggesting that 10 experts are the minimum acceptable number for interviews (Salamirad, 2023). The number of stakeholders involved is discussed in various papers, particularly in areas like sustainability, where the literature highlights the importance of broad representation, with studies averaging 25 stakeholders per study (Diaz-Balteiro L, 2017).
