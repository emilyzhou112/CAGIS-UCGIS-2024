# Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)

The scope and variety of MCDM applications have grown significantly in the last decades. A number of reviews identify, classify and assess MCDM methods used in areas like renewable energy (Kumar A, 2017), sustainability (Diaz-Balteiro L, 2017), water-related issues (de Castro-Pardo M, 2021) (Gebre S L, 2021), infrastructure (Kabir G, 2013) (Broniewicz E, 2020), to name just a few.

The use of MCDM methodology seems to be infrequent at the local level (Kumar A, 2017). 

As pointed out by Kumar et al, MCDM analysis is further complicated because the priorities of decision makes can lead to different solutions or even change over time. Furthermore, different methods can be used for the same problem depending on how the functions are defined (Kumar A, 2017). This is why numerous case studies in MCDM assess the same problem with different methods and compare results (Ilangkumaran M, 2013) (Lee HC, 2018) (Broniewicz E, 2020).

To summarize, the MCDM process involves the following stages: 
1. selecting criteria and alternatives, 
2. selecting MCDM methods for weighting the criteria and ranking the alternatives, and 
3. selecting the optimal solutions. 

Kumar (2017) proposes a MCDM process that includes defining objectives, selecting criteria, selecting alternatives, weighting criteria, prioritizing alternatives, selecting MCDM methods, and selecting and presenting the best alternative for assessment (Kumar A, 2017). Ilangkumaran (2013) proposed three stages for the MCDM process, including criteria and alternatives selection, MCDM methods selection for weighting, and selection for ranking (Ilangkumaran M, 2013).

## Long term decision-making - a replicable framework
How to bridge the gap between short term decision making and long-term planning? 
- Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) for short term decisions. 
- Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways and Robust Decision Making for long term planning. 

The use of a MCDM framework based on characterization of utilities and alternatives could inform short term choices considering known constraints and preferences. On the other hand, DAPP has been identified by practitioners as an adequate method for enabling long term policy planning in a conext of rapidly changing projections regarding future states of EV usage/climate scenarios. (Haasnoot, M. et al 2013)

The innovation lies in developing a structured and replicable framework that:
- can be adapted to different locations, 
- explicitly assesses the integration of different decision timelines and methodologies
